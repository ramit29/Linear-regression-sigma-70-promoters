# Linear-regression-sigma-70-promoters
Here multivariate linear regression has been used to predict the strength of sigma 70 core promoters.

Data set is 19 anderson promoters developed by anderson lab in UC Berkley - http://parts.igem.org/Promoters/Catalog/Anderson

The -10 and -35 hexamer motifs have been scored to predict the strength of sigma 70 promoters.
Their pssm was calculated and normalized as the two inputs.

Multivariant.py is the final code.

Another model will be generated soon  which doesn't use pssm, but frequence scores.
